## Hi there 👋, I am Riccardo!

I am an environmental scientist  based in Germany since 2012. I have a passion for exploratory data analysis and statistic.
I like to learn new coding tricks with R and try to apply them to interesting datasets. 
I try also to merge my passion of sports and videogames with coding.

## To sum it up:

- 😏 I’m a R and KNIME user 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQlite
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
