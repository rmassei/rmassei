## Hej you! Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Riccardo and I am a data scientist and data engineer with a long-time background in environmental sciences and toxicology. 

I am from Italy, living in Leipzig and currently working in UFZ! I am actively working in the field of data management and FAIR data. 

In the last years, I worked actively with image objects and analysis.

I like to blend together different programming languages such as R, Python or Java using the analytical platform KNIME.

I  have long term experience in building user-friendly workflows to increase reproducibily in life science and allows people with no experience in coding to run their own ideas or analysis workflows. I am also a freelancer teacher of KNIME in my working instution.

## To sum it up:
- Proficient with KNIME :sunglasses:
- I am a Python and R enthusiast :heart_eyes:
- We can have a chat about Java :coffee:
