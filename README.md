## Hej you! Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Riccardo and I am a data scientist with a long-time background in environmental sciences and toxicology. 

I am from Italy, living in Leipzig since 2012 and currently working in UFZ. I am actively working in the field of data management and FAIR data. 

In the last years, I worked with the analysis of image object using python. I am also occasionally working on the analysis and visualization of behavioural datasets collected from danio rerio larvae and gammarus pulex using automatic tracking systems.

I like to blend together different programming languages such as Python and R using the analytical platform KNIME. In the last month, I have a growing interest in using Galaxy as a platform to produce reproducible data.

I  have long term experience in building user-friendly workflows to increase reproducibily in life science and allows people with no experience in coding to run their own ideas or analysis workflows. I am also a freelancer teacher of KNIME and OMERO in my working instution.
